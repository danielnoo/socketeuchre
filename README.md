![playthrough of euchre hand in this app](euchre.gif)


An app I created using HTML, SASS, CSS-Grid, Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io

You'll need four players to play a game!

To install it locally: clone -> npm install -> npm start

*This app contains code that I wrote a long time ago - re-writing it in a modern framework is on my todo-list because it badly needs state management :-)
