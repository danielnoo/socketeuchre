Make a leave room option 

cap rooms at 4 players 

make some sort of function in the users.js file that grabs creates a users array based on room name and passes to the start of the game

starting with socketRooms that should act as source of truth from the start of the game 

a function in users.js will have to grab the users in the room right at the start of the game, before the teams are arranged.

after that, every function in the life cycle of the game will have to be edited so as to have access to the rooms object instead of users array 
                                                <--array of objects
socketRooms = {
  "asdads's Room" : [                     
    
    {
    id: 'DjsMQWGAWjMAWxvfAAAF',
    userName: 'asdads',
    roomName: undefined,
    host: false,
    turn: false,
    cards: []
  },
    {
    id: 'DjsMQWGAWjMAWxvfAAAF',
    userName: 'asdads',
    roomName: undefined,
    host: false,
    turn: false,
    cards: []
  },
  {
    id: 'DjsMQWGAWjMAWxvfAAAF',
    userName: 'asdads',
    roomName: undefined,
    host: false,
    turn: false,
    cards: []
  },
  {
    id: 'DjsMQWGAWjMAWxvfAAAF',
    userName: 'asdads',
    roomName: undefined,
    host: false,
    turn: false,
    cards: []
  }
  ] 
}

the dynamic key name should be generated server-side and could just be the username of the host
--- will use the name of the user's room

so function in users.js should take all users with the same room name and put them into an array of objects as above.
